Localist is a beginner-first guide, not another giant tool list. You start from the
machine you already own, follow one guide, and skip the other 50 options. And it
doesn't rot: a pipeline — not vibes — refreshes the
[Fresh updates](#-fresh-updates) section every morning, and we review and prune
stale recommendations instead of hoarding them.

## 🚀 Start here — pick your hardware

Don't read everything. Find your row, follow one guide, and you'll be chatting with a
local model in under 15 minutes.

| I have… | Your guide |
|---|---|
| **An NVIDIA GPU** (any GeForce RTX) | [NVIDIA GPU path](guides/nvidia-gpu.md) |
| **A Mac with Apple Silicon** (M-series) | [Mac path](guides/mac-apple-silicon.md) |
| **An AMD GPU** (Radeon RX) | [AMD GPU path](guides/amd-gpu.md) |
| **Just a laptop / no GPU** | [CPU-only path](guides/cpu-only.md) |
| **A mini PC or home server** | [CPU-only path](guides/cpu-only.md) — or the [NVIDIA path](guides/nvidia-gpu.md) if it has a GPU |
| **No idea what I have** | [Start here](guides/start-here.md) |

Everything here can run locally; many paths work offline after setup, and your
prompts stay on your machine unless you connect a cloud service.

## 🧰 The essentials

One opinionated pick per category. Alternatives are inside each entry — but if
you're new, just take the pick and move on.

**Which tool first?** Want clicks? Start with LM Studio. Comfortable with one
command? Start with Ollama. You do not need both.

| Category | Our pick | Why this one |
|---|---|---|
| **Model runner** | [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) | One command to install, one to run a model. The de-facto beginner standard. |
| **Desktop app** | [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) | Point-and-click everything: browse, download, and chat with models. No terminal needed. |
| **Web UI** | [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) | ChatGPT-style interface on top of Ollama. Multi-user, chat with your documents, voice. |
| **Chat models** | [Qwen3 family](https://ollama.com/library/qwen3) | Strong at every size, tiny to huge. Which size fits you → [choosing models](guides/choosing-models.md). |
| **Coding models** | [Qwen Coder](https://ollama.com/library/qwen3-coder) | Same idea, meaningfully better at code. Pairs with the coding agent below. |
| **Coding agent** | [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) | Most popular open-source coding agent; points at your local models. |
| **Image generation** | [ComfyUI](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI) | Node-based, runs every major open image model. Steeper curve, unmatched power. |
| **Chat with your docs** | [AnythingLLM](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm) | Point it at a folder and a local model — done. |
| **Speech-to-text** | [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp) | Fast local transcription on any hardware. |
| **Text-to-speech** | [Piper](https://github.com/OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl) | Fast, natural offline voices — runs even on a Raspberry Pi. |

When you outgrow beginner tools, [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)
is the engine worth learning — it's what most of the tools above are built on.

The full curated set (with licenses, hardware fit, and honest caveats) lives in
[`data/curated.yml`](data/curated.yml) — it's the single source of truth these
picks come from.

## 📚 New to all of this?

The [glossary](guides/glossary.md) explains every term you'll bump into —
GGUF, quantization, context window, VRAM, tokens/sec — in plain words.
And [choosing models](guides/choosing-models.md) answers the #1 question:
*which model size actually fits my machine?*
